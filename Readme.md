# Pattern Recognition Project

## About activity monitoring
- Activity Monitoring is one popular
application field of Ubiquitous
Computing.
- Goal: detect a specific set of
activities using sensors worn by a
subject providing data in real-time
- Applications: surveillance, gaming,
remote control, assistive living, ...
- Principle: classification problem
-Problem: how to obtain a (good)
trained classifier?
### The Cognitive Village dataset (1/6)
- In practice, data acquisition step = one of the most difficult step of
the processing chain
- In this project, we will use the Cognitive Village (CogAge) dataset
- Note: some steps of the PRC have already been processed with the
CogAge dataset.
